# Image Smoothing Filters in Python

This python program implements four image smoothing filters: **5×5 Triangle Filter, 5×5 Gaussian Filter, 5×5 Median Filter, and 5×5 Kuwahara Filter.** It takes an image input from the user. It also includes an option to add noise to the input image and then apply these filters.

## Features
- **Noise Addition**: Adds noise to the image via a button.
- **Filters**: Implements 5×5 Triangle, Gaussian (with Sigma), Median, and Kuwahara filters.
- **Boundary Handling**: Uses nearest pixel for out-of-bound pixels.
